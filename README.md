## Working with Notion as CMS

- **Setup**: Duplicate the [Notion template](https://pickyzz.notion.site/b60241fb283943c29acd6bc6c91acc77?v=f688e711757a47339b30e33f1fbf8d7e&pvs=4) and configure your environment variables
- **Development sync**: Use `npm run sync` (all posts) or `npm run sync:published` (published posts only)
- **Production build**: Use `npm run generate` to sync published posts and build for production

## Development

Start the development server with live reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser to see your project.

## Production Build

### Manual Deployment

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build

Or sync content and build in one command:

```bash

```

The generated files will be in the `dist` folder, ready for deployment to any hosting service.
